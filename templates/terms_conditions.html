Prior to seeking arbitration, you must send an e-mail to us and include all of your reasons for dissatisfaction with your Program. You also agree that should arbitration take place, it will be held in Miami, Florida, and the prevailing party shall be entitled to all reasonable attorneys’ fees and all costs necessary to enforce the decision of the arbitrator.  You further understand and agree now that the only remedy that can be awarded to you through arbitration is full refund of your Payment made to date. No other actions or financial awards of consequential damages, or any other type of damages, may be granted to you. We both agree now that the decision of the arbitrator is final and binding, and may be entered as a judgment into any court having the appropriate jurisdiction. You also agree that this document shall be construed with the laws of the State of Florida.</p>
