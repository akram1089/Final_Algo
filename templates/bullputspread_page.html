                    <h3>Strategy Type:</h3>
                    <p>Bull Put Spread is a bullish strategy. It is used when the investor expects the underlying asset's price to rise moderately.  </p>
                </div>
        
                <div class="mt-3">
                    <h3>Components: The strategy involves two main components:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Short Put Option: </span> The investor sells (writes) a put option with a higher strike price. By doing this, they may be obligated to buy the underlying asset at the strike price if the option is exercised by the option buyer.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3"><span>Long Put Option:</span>  Simultaneously, the investor buys a put option with a lower strike price. This option provides protection and limits potential losses.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
    
                <div>
                    <h3>Profit and Loss Potential:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <span class="text-success"> Maximum Profit:</span> The maximum profit is limited to the net premium received when selling the put minus the premium paid for the long put.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3"> <span class="text-danger">Maximum Loss:</span>  The maximum loss is limited to the difference between the strike prices of the two put options minus the net premium received.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
    
                <div class="mt-3">
                  <span class="fw-bold fs-5">Break-Even Point:</span> <span>The break-even point is the strike price of the short put minus the net premium received.</span>
                </div>
    
                <div class="mt-3">
                    <h3>Strategy Goals:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The primary goal of a Bull Put Spread is to profit from a moderately bullish or neutral market by generating income through the premium received for selling the higher strike put option.</li>
                        <li>The strategy is designed to limit risk compared to simply selling a put option by providing downside protection through the long put.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                 
                <div class="mt-3">
                    <h3>Risk Management:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The maximum risk is limited to the difference between the strike prices minus the net premium received.</li>
                        <li>The strategy is suitable for investors who expect moderate bullishness and want to control risk.</li>
