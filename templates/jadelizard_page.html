          <h3>Strategy Type:</h3>
          <p>Moderately Bullish and Income-Generating</p>
        </div>

        <div class="mt-3">
          <h3>Components: The strategy involves two main components:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span> Short Put Option: </span>The investor sells (writes) an
              out-of-the-money put option with a specific strike price.
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3">
              <span>Short Call Spread: </span>Simultaneously, the investor sells
              (writes) an out-of-the-money call option with a higher strike
              price and buys a call option with an even higher strike price
              (creating a bear call spread). This limits potential losses on the
              upside.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Profit and Loss Potential:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="text-success"> Maximum Profit:</span>The maximum
              profit is limited and occurs if the underlying asset's price rises
              and remains above the strike price of the short call option. The
              profit is capped at the premium received from selling the put and
              the call spread.
            </li>
            <li class="mt-3">
              <span class="text-danger">Maximum Loss:</span>The maximum loss is
              limited and occurs if the underlying asset's price falls
              significantly below the strike price of the short put option. The
              loss is limited to the difference between the strike price of the
              short put and the short call option minus the net premium
              received.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mt-3">
          <span class="fw-bold fs-5">Break-Even Point:</span>
          <span
            >There are multiple break-even points based on the specifics of the
            options used. These points can be calculated based on the strike
            prices of the options.</span

        <div class="mt-3">
          <h3>Strategy Goals:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The primary goal of a Jade Lizard is to generate income by
              collecting premiums from selling the put and the short call spread
              while also providing some upside protection.
            </li>
            <li>
              The strategy is suitable when an investor has a moderately bullish
              outlook on the underlying asset.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mt-3">
          <h3>Risk Management:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The risk is limited to the difference between the strike prices of
              the short put and short call options, minus the net premium
              received. This defines the maximum loss.
            </li>
            <li>
              The strategy offers controlled risk with limited profit potential.
            </li>
          </ul>
