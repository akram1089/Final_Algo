                <h3>Strategy Type:</h3>
                <p>A short put is a bearish to neutral options strategy. It's employed when the investor has a neutral to slightly bearish outlook on the underlying asset's price.</p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="mt-3">
                <h3>Components: The strategy involves two main components:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="fw-bold">Short Put Option:</span>  The investor writes (sells) a put option contract. By doing so, they are obligated to buy the underlying asset at the strike price if the option is exercised by the option buyer.</li>
                    <li class="mt-3"><span>Cash Collateral: </span>  The investor receives a premium (payment) for selling the put option, which is kept as collateral. The premium serves as compensation for taking on the potential obligation to buy the asset.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Profit and Loss Potential:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maximum Profit: The maximum profit in a short put strategy is limited to the premium received when selling the put option. It's realized if the option expires worthless (out of the money).</li>
                    <li class="mt-3">Maximum Loss: The maximum loss is potentially significant. It occurs if the underlying asset's price falls to zero, and the investor is forced to buy the asset at the strike price. The loss is reduced by the premium received.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="mt-3">
              <span class="fw-bold fs-5">Break-Even Point:</span> <span>The break-even point is the strike price minus the premium received. As long as the underlying asset's price remains above this level at expiration, the strategy is profitable.</span>
            </div>

            <div class="mt-3">
                <h3>Strategy Goals:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The primary goal of a short put strategy is to generate income through the premium received when selling the put option.</li>
                    <li>If the investor's outlook is neutral, they aim for the option to expire worthless, allowing them to keep the premium.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
             
            <div class="mt-3">
                <h3>Risk Management:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Traders should be prepared to buy the underlying asset at the strike price if the option is exercised. Therefore, it's essential to have sufficient capital to cover this potential obligation.</li>
                    <li>Some investors use stop-loss orders or have predetermined exit strategies in case the trade goes against them.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
