                    <h3>Strategy Type:</h3>
                    <p>Short Synthetic is a bearish strategy. It is used when an investor expects the underlying asset's price to decrease.</p>
                </div>
        
                <div class="mt-3">
                    <h3>Components: The strategy involves two main components:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span> Short Call Option: </span>The investor sells (writes) a call option with a specific strike price. This option gives the investor an obligation to sell the underlying asset at the strike price if the option is exercised by the option buyer.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3"><span>Long Put Option: </span>  Simultaneously, the investor buys a put option with the same strike price as the short call. This put option provides downside protection and limits potential losses.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
    
                <div>
                    <h3>Profit and Loss Potential:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <span class="text-success"> Maximum Profit:</span> The maximum profit is limited to the premium received from selling the call option.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3"> <span class="text-danger">Maximum Loss:</span>  The maximum loss is theoretically unlimited if the underlying asset's price increases significantly. The loss is partially offset by the premium received from selling the call. </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
    
                <div class="mt-3">
                  <span class="fw-bold fs-5">Break-Even Point:</span> <span>The break-even point is the strike price of the short call plus the premium received.</span>
                </div>
    
                <div class="mt-3">
                    <h3>Strategy Goals:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The primary goal of a Short Synthetic is to profit from a bearish view on the underlying asset by effectively mimicking the risk profile of short selling the asset.</li>
                        <li>The strategy aims to generate income through the sale of the call option.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="mt-3">
                    <h3>Risk Management:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The risk is theoretically unlimited if the asset's price rises significantly. However, the premium received from selling the call partially offsets potential losses.</li>
                        <li>The strategy provides controlled risk through the long put option, which offers protection against excessive losses.</li>
