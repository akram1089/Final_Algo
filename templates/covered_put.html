        <h2 class="mb-3 fs-5">Covered Put</h2>
        <p class="mb-3">
         Covered Put is created when a trader feels that the stock price is going to remain range bound. It is the opposite of the moderately bullish covered call strategy. In order to create a covered put, you have to short a stock and short a stock and also short put options on the stock.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
         The put sold is generally at the money or slightly out of the money. The investor is moderately bearish on a stock and shorts it but will buy it back once it reaches a target price (the strike price he shorted the put option at). The trader who wrote the put option, is subjected to a very high risk if there is a dramatic rise in the stock price. As the stock price has no limit, the risk here is very high.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>When to Use: If the investor is of the view that the markets are moderately bearish.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Risk:</b> Unlimited if the price of the stock rises substantially.
        </p>
        <p><b>Reward: </b> Maximum is (Sale Price of the Stock â€“ Strike Price) + Put Premium.</p>
        <p><b>Breakeven:</b> Sale Price of Stock + Put Premium.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Profit when: </b> Premium Received - Commissions Paid.
        </p>
        <p> <b>Loss when: </b>Price of Underlying - Sale Price of Underlying - Premium Received + Commissions Paid. </p>
