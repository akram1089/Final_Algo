      <p>A stock gap is created when a securityâ€™s price opens significantly above or below its prior closing price.</p>  

     <p>The fill the gap concept implies that the security will eventually retrace the gap and trade at its pre-gap price. Gaps can fill immediately, over time, or not at all. </p>
