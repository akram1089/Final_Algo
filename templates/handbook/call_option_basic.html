     <p> A call option gives the buyer the right, but no obligation, to buy an underlying asset at a specific strike price on or before an expiration date.</p>  

     <p>A call option seller is obligated to sell the underlying asset at the optionâ€™s strike price if the option is assigned or the option expires in-the-money. </p> 

      <p>Each equity option contract is equivalent to 100 shares of the underlying asset.</p>      
     
     <p>For example, if you buy a call option with a $100 strike price, you have the right to exercise the option and purchase 100 shares per contract at $100. </p> 

      <p>It the option costs $1.00, the maximum risk is $100 per contract, and the profit potential is unlimited.</p>
