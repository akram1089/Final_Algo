        <p>Many traders use the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to identify extreme levels in the market and as a mean reversion indicator to guide their trading decisions.</p>

        <h3>What is RSI?</h3>
        <p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum indicator that measures the speed and change of price on a scale of 0 to 100, typically over the past 14 periods. It compares up days and down days to assess the strength of a security's price change.</p>
    
        <p>RSI is a bounded oscillator between 0 and 100, with readings above 50 indicating an uptrend and readings below 50 suggesting a downtrend. Overbought conditions are typically signaled when RSI is above 70, and oversold conditions when RSI is below 30.</p>
    
        <p>RSI is calculated as follows:</p>
        <pre><code>RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))</code></pre>
        <p>Where RS (Relative Strength) is the average gain divided by the average loss over a specified period.</p>
    
        <h3>How to Trade Using RSI</h3>
        <p>Traders often use oversold readings (RSI below 30) as an opportunity to "buy the dip" and enter bullish positions. Conversely, overbought readings (RSI above 70) may indicate a potential pullback, but strong trends can sustain high RSI readings for an extended period.</p>
    
        <p>The midpoint of RSI is 50, and it can be used as a moving average indicator. A bullish cross of 50 signals a change in trend and can serve as an entry indicator. Traders may also use the RSI midline for exit criteria, exiting a bullish position when RSI falls from 70 to 50 as upward momentum weakens.</p>
    
        <p>RSI can be applied to various timeframes, including intraday, daily, and weekly charts, based on the closing price for each period.</p>
    
        <h3>Trading RSI Divergences</h3>
        <p>RSI is often used in conjunction with price action to identify divergences. Traders look for higher highs in price coupled with higher highs in RSI for bullish divergence, and a failure swing, where price makes a new low but RSI fails to make a new low, for bearish divergence.</p>
    
        
    
        <p>Similar to MACD, RSI is employed to confirm price moves for a security. Confirmation occurs when both the security's price and the RSI indicator give the same trading signal.</p>
    
        <h2>FAQs</h2>
    
        <h3>Is a high RSI good or bad?</h3>
        <p>A high RSI reading, over 70, is neither inherently good nor bad. It may indicate that a security is temporarily overbought, but prices can continue to increase for an unknown period. RSI above 70 suggests caution and a potential for a pullback.</p>
