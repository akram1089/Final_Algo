     <h4>What is inflation?</h4>
     <p>
        Inflation is an increase in prices and a decrease in the purchasing value of money.  Inflation can be described as too much money chasing too few goods, resulting in decreased purchasing power. <br> <br>

        The rate of inflation is the percentage rate of change of a price index over time. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is the standard measure of consumer goods price inflation.  <br> <br>
        
        A primary cause of inflation is an increase in the money supply. When more money is available to spend but the same amount of goods available to buy, prices will go up. To keep prices stable, governments and central banks, such as the Federal Reserve’s FOMC, attempt to control the money supply and keep inflation at a manageable level.  <br> <br>
        
        Too much inflation can be detrimental to an economy, but a small amount of inflation is often considered good for economic growth.

    <h4>How does inflation impact You</h4>
    <p>
        Inflation impacts everyone differently depending on their stage in life, occupation, and spending habits. <br> <br>

        Inflation can be a real problem for seniors living on a fixed income as the cost of living increases steadily while their income stays the same.  <br> <br>
        
        Young adults just starting out may also find it difficult to keep up with inflationary pressures, especially if they are still paying off student loans. <br> <br>
        
        Low-wage workers are also hit hard by inflation as their earnings often fail to keep pace with rising prices. <br> <br>
        
        However, some individuals and corporations benefit from inflation. People who own assets such as property or stocks typically see their values increase as inflation increases. Businesses can also benefit from inflation as it tends to boost profits and encourages expansion. <br> <br>
        
        Ultimately, inflation is a complex economic concept that affects all people differently.

    <h4>The myths of inflation</h4>
    <p>
        There are many popular myths about inflation, but it's important to understand the facts. Inflation is simply a sustained increase in the price level. It is caused by many factors, including increased demand, supply shocks, and changes in monetary policy.  <br> <br>

        While inflation can be harmful to the economy, it's important to remember that moderate inflation is not necessarily bad. In fact, many economists believe that a little inflation can actually be beneficial to an economy.

    <h4>What can you do to protect yourself from inflation?</h4>
    <p>
        As prices continue to rise, many people are concerned about the effects of inflation. While there is no sure way to protect yourself from inflation, you can take a few steps to minimize its impact. <br> <br>

        One way to combat inflation is to invest in assets that are likely to increase in value. This could include stocks, real estate, or collectibles. Another way to reduce the effects of inflation is to avoid debt. If you have outstanding debts, try to pay them off quickly. <br> <br>
        
        Finally, it is important to remember that inflation is a gradual process. By taking steps to reduce its impact now, you can help ensure that your finances can weather the storm in the future.
