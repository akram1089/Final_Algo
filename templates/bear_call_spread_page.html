                    <h3>Strategy Type:</h3>
                    <p>Bear Call Spread is a moderately bearish strategy. It is used when an investor expects the underlying asset's price to decrease but not significantly.</p>
                </div>
        
                <div class="mt-3">
                    <h3>Components: The strategy involves two main components:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span> Long Call Options: </span>The investor sells (writes) a call option with a specific strike price. This option gives the investor an obligation to sell the underlying asset at the strike price if the option is exercised by the option buyer.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3"><span>Short Call Option: </span>  Simultaneously, the investor buys a call option with a higher strike price. This option provides protection and limits potential losses.</li>

                <div>
                    <h3>Profit and Loss Potential:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <span class="text-success"> Maximum Profit:</span> The maximum profit is limited to the net premium received when selling the call minus the premium paid for the long call.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3"> <span class="text-danger">Maximum Loss:</span>  The maximum loss is limited to the difference between the strike prices of the two call options minus the net premium received. </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
    
                <div class="mt-3">
                  <span class="fw-bold fs-5">Break-Even Point:</span> <span>The break-even point is the strike price of the short call plus the net premium received.</span>

                <div class="mt-3">
                    <h3>Strategy Goals:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The primary goal of a Bear Call Spread is to profit from a moderate price decrease in the underlying asset.</li>
                        <li>The strategy is designed to limit risk compared to simply selling a call option by providing upside protection through the long call.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <h3>Risk Management:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The risk is limited to the difference in strike prices minus the net premium received.</li>
                        <li>The strategy is suitable for investors who expect moderate bearishness and want to control risk.</li>
