                    <h3>Strategy Type:</h3>
                    <p>Call Ratio Back Spread is a volatility-based strategy. It's used when an investor expects a significant price movement but is unsure about the direction (up or down) of that movement. </p>
                </div>
        
                <div class="mt-3">
                    <h3>Components: The strategy involves two main components:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Short Call Option: </span> The investor buys a certain number of call options with a lower strike price (the strike at which they have the right to buy the underlying asset).</li>
                        <li class="mt-3"><span>Long Call Option:</span> Simultaneously, the investor sells (writes) a greater number of call options with a higher strike price (the strike at which they may be obligated to sell the underlying asset if the option is exercised).</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
    
                <div>
                    <h3>Profit and Loss Potential:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <span class="text-success"> Maximum Profit:</span> The maximum profit is theoretically unlimited if the underlying asset's price rises significantly. The profit increases as the asset's price goes up.</li>
                        <li class="mt-3"> <span class="text-danger">Maximum Loss:</span>  The maximum loss is limited to the difference in strike prices minus the net premium received or paid for the options.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
    
                <div class="mt-3">
                  <span class="fw-bold fs-5">Break-Even Point:</span> <span>There can be multiple break-even points depending on the specifics of the strategy. Typically, the strategy has a lower break-even point equal to the lower strike price plus the net premium received and an upper break-even point equal to the higher strike price.</span>
                </div>
    
                <div class="mt-3">
                    <h3>Strategy Goals:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The primary goal of a Call Ratio Back Spread is to profit from a significant price movement in the underlying asset, regardless of the direction.</li>
                        <li>The strategy is asymmetrical, with potentially unlimited upside profit if the asset's price rises significantly.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                 
                <div class="mt-3">
                    <h3>Risk Management:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The risk is limited to the net premium received or paid for the options.</li>
                        <li>The strategy offers protection against a significant adverse price movement as the long call options provide a hedge.</li>
                    </ul>
