            <p class="fs-5 label-color-6">
              A bear call spread is a limited-risk-limited-reward strategy,
              consisting of one short call option and one long call option. This
              strategy generally profits if the stock price holds steady or
              declines. It is one of the basic option strategies.

              The most it can generate is the net premium received at the

              the losses grow only until long call caps the amount.

            A bear put spread consists of buying one put and selling another
            put, at a lower strike, to offset part of the upfront cost. The
            spread generally profits if the stock price moves lower. The
            potential profit is limited, but so is the risk should the stock
            unexpectedly rally. also a simple and most used option strategies

              This strategy is the combination of a bear put spread and a bear
              call spread. A key part of the strategy is to initiate the
              position at even money, so the cost of the put spread should be
              offset by the proceeds from the call spread.

            A bull put spread is a limited-risk-limited-reward strategy,
            consisting of a short put option and a long put option with a lower
            strike. This spread generally profits if the stock price holds

            This strategy is the combination of a bull call spread and a bull

          <p class="fs-5 label-color-6">

            The cash-secured put involves writing a put option and
            simultaneously setting aside the cash to buy the stock if assigned.
            If things go as hoped, it allows an investor to buy the stock at a
            price below its current market value.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-4">
            The investor must be prepared for the possibility that the put won’t
            be assigned. In that case, the investor simply keeps the interest on
            the T-Bill and the premium received for selling the put option.

              temporary, slightly less-than-complete hedge against the effects
              of a possible near-term decline. The long put strike provides a
              minimum selling price for the stock, and the short call strike

              This strategy consists of writing a call that is covered by an
              equivalent long stock position. It provides a small hedge on the
              stock and allows an investor to earn premium income, in return for
              temporarily forfeiting much of the stock’s upside potential.

          <p class="fs-5 label-color-6">
            This strategy is used to arbitrage a put that is overvalued because
            of its early-exercise feature. The investor simultaneously sells an
            in-the-money put at its intrinsic value and shorts the stock, and
            then invests the proceeds in an instrument earning the overnight
            interest rate. When the option is exercised, the position liquidates
            at breakeven, but the investor keeps the interest earned.

          <p class="fs-5 label-color-6">
            This strategy profits if the underlying stock moves up to, but not
            above, the strike price of the short calls. Beyond that, the profit
            is eroded and then hits a plateau.

          <p class="fs-5 label-color-6">
            This strategy is appropriate for a stock considered to be fairly
            valued. The investor has a long stock position and is willing to
            sell the stock if it goes higher or buy more of the stock if it goes
            lower.

          <p class="fs-5 label-color-6">
            This strategy consists of buying a call option. It is a candidate
            for investors who want a chance to participate in the underlying
            stock’s expected appreciation during the term of the option. If
            things go as planned, the investor will be able to sell the call at
            a profit at some point before expiration.

          <h4 class="mb-3 label-color-4 fs-5">Long Call Calendar Spread</h4>
          <p class="fs-5 label-color-6">
            This strategy combines a longer-term bullish outlook with a
            near-term neutral/bearish outlook. If the underlying stock remains
            steady or declines during the life of the near-term option, that
            option will expire worthless and leave the investor owning the
            longer-term option free and clear. If both options have the same

          <p class="fs-5 label-color-6">
            This strategy is simple. It consists of acquiring stock in
            anticipation of rising prices. The gains, if there are any, are
            realized only when the asset is sold. Until that time, the investor
            faces the possibility of partial or total loss of the investment,
            should the stock lose value.

            In principle, this strategy imposes no fixed timeline. However,
            special circumstances could delay or accelerate an exit. For
            example, a margin purchase is subject to margin calls at any time,
            which could force a quick sale unexpectedly.

            rising stock price. It does best if the option expires worthless.

          <h4 class="mb-3 label-color-4 fs-5">Protective Put</h4>
          <p class="fs-5 label-color-6">
            This strategy consists of adding a long put position to a long stock
            position. The protective put establishes a ‘floor’ price under which
            investor’s stock value cannot fall..
          </p>
          <p class="fs-5 label-color-6">
            If the stock keeps rising, the investor benefits from the upside
            gains. Yet no matter how low the stock might fall, the investor can
            exercise the put to liquidate the stock at the strike price.

          <h4 class="mb-3 label-color-4 fs-5">Short Call Butterfly</h4>
          <p class="fs-5 label-color-6">
            This strategy profits if the underlying stock is outside the wings
            of the butterfly at expiration.

          <h4 class="mb-3 label-color-4 fs-5">Short Call Calendar Spread</h4>
          <p class="fs-5 label-color-6">
            This strategy profits from the different characteristics of near and
            longer-term call options. If the stock holds steady, the strategy
            suffers from time decay. If the underlying stock moves sharply up or
            down, both options will move toward their intrinsic value or zero,
            thus narrowing the difference between their values. If both options
            have the same strike price, the strategy will always receive a
            premium when initiating the position.

            A candidate for bearish investors who wish to profit from a
            depreciation in the stock’s price. The strategy involves borrowing
            stock through the brokerage firm and selling the shares in the
            marketplace at the prevailing price. The goal is to buy them back
            later at a lower price, thereby locking in a profit.

          <h4 class="mb-3 label-color-4 fs-5">Short Straddle</h4>
          <p class="fs-5 label-color-6">
            This strategy involves selling a call option and a put option with
            the same expiration and strike price. It generally profits if the
            stock price and volatility remain steady.

          <p class="fs-5 label-color-6">
            This strategy can profit from a steady stock price, or from a
            falling implied volatility. The actual behavior of the strategy
            depends largely on the delta, theta and Vega of the combined
            position as well as whether a debit is paid or a credit received
            when initiating the position.

          <p class="fs-5 label-color-6">
            This strategy combines a long call and a short stock position. Its
            payoff profile is equivalent to a long put’s characteristics. The
            strategy profits if the stock price moves lower–the more
            dramatically, the better. The time horizon is limited to the life of
            the option.

          <h4 class="mb-3 label-color-4 fs-5">Synthetic Long Stock</h4>
          <p class="fs-5 label-color-6">
            This strategy is essentially a long futures position on the
            underlying stock. The long call and the short put combined simulate
            a long stock position. The net result entails the same risk/reward
            profile, though only for the term of the option: unlimited potential
            for appreciation, and large (though limited) risk should the
            underlying stock fall in value.

        <p class="mb-3">
          When you long an option, it simply means that you buy it with the
          expectation that it will rise in value. A long call gives you the
          right but not the obligation to buy a security at a particular
          price. Call options are often used as an alternative to buying the
          stock directly. Since there is no limit as to how high the stock
          price can be at expiration date, the profit potential is
          “unlimited”. Also, in options trading, you avoid all of the risk
          that would result from direct ownership of a security.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          Note: Buying too many options increases the risk as, call options
          have a limited lifespan. If the stock price does not move above the
          strike price before the option expiry, the option will expire
          worthless. When options expire worthless, you will lose your entire
          investment. On the other hand if you own a security, it will still
          be worth something.

        <p class="mb-3">
          Buying a Put option is just the opposite of buying a Call option.
          You buy a Call option when you are bullish about a security. When a
          trader is bearish, he can buy a Put option contract. A Put Option
          gives the holder of the Put a right, but not the obligation, to sell
          a security at a pre-specified price.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          A long Put is a Bearish strategy. To take advantage of a falling
          market an traders buy Put options. If the price of the stock falls,
          the put option increases. This is one of the most commonly used
          strategy when an investor is bearish.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-3">
          A long put is also used by traders in order to hedge against
          unfavorable moves in a long stock position. This hedging strategy is
          known as married put.

        <p class="mb-3">
         The covered call position (also called buy-write position) is created when you either buy or pre-own a stock and sell call options on that stock. If the call options are exercised the trader will sell the stock at the strike price, and if the call options are not exercised the trader will keep the stock. Usually, call options are sold out of the money. But, If you think that the stock price will go down, and you are still willing to hold your stock position, you can sell an in the money call option.

        <p class="mb-3">
          <b>When to Use:</b> This is often employed when an investor has a short-term neutral to moderately bullish view on the stock he holds. He takes a short position on the Call option to generate income from the option premium. Since the stock is purchased simultaneously with writing (selling) the Call, the strategy is commonly referred to as “buy-write

          When you expect the price of a stock to fall, you do the opposite of the Long Call. You can sell Call options, when you are highly bearish on a stock. It is important to clear that, this position has a limited profit potential and the possibility of large losses. It is a risky strategy since the seller of the Call is exposed to unlimited risk. It is suggested not to carry overnight positions. Also, you should always strictly comply with Stop Loss in order to regulate your losses.

          This strategy is used when an investor is aggressive and strongly believes that the price is going to fall. This is a risky strategy as, if the stock price rises, the short call loses money at a fast pace and the seller may suffer significant losses. Since the trader does not own the underlying stock that he is shorting, this strategy is often called Short Naked Call. Again, the maximum profit to be made from this strategy is the amount of premium paid.

         We may form a straddle strategy when we expect the stock price to show large movements. In order to create a long straddle, we buy one ATM call option and one ATM put option on the same stock for the same maturity and strike price. Doing this, we are able to take the advantage of the market whether it goes up or comes down. If there is an increase in the stock price, the call is exercised and the put expires worthless. On the other hand, if the price of the stock decreases, the put option is exercised while the call option expires.

        When we create a short straddle, we do so with a feeling that the market will not show any major movements.

        <p class="mb-3">
          To create a Protective call, you begin with shorting a stock and buying a call option on that stock. You create a protective call when you are bearish on a stock. But in order to protect your decision of shorting the stock, you buy a call option. Protective call is also known as synthetic long put. This is because the payoff chart of this strategy looks like a long put payoff chart. The strategy offers limited risk and unlimited profit. This strategy is the opposite of the Synthetic Call option strategy. The call option you buy, is either at the money or slightly out of the money. When the price of the stock falls, you don't exercise the call option. And when the price is higher than the break-even point, at the time of expiry, you can exercise the option and earn the profit.
